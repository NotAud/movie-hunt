# MovieHunt

## Features

- Search for movies via Genre Selection
- Preview movie details and trailer
- Add movies to favorites
- View favorite movies at any time

## Description

We wanted to find a way to simplify searching for movies by the genres you like. We are able to catalog a list of movies you find by searching for related genres and save them for you to look at later. Through this project we learned how to integrate a server-side API and create a UI to reflect the information from that API.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

This project requires two api keys: One from OMDB and another from TMDB.
The OMDB API key can be requested from here: https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx

The TMDB API key can be requested from here: https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api

OMDB does not require an account, but TMDB requires you to sign-up before generating a key.

## Usage

To use the APP 'Login' with your two API keys. Once you have valid API keys, you can start selecting genres you would like to search by. After searching by the genres you selected, a carousel of movies will be available for selection. By clicking any of these movies, you may get some general information about them and watch a preview. If any movie looks interesting you may click a favorites button, which can be viewed at any later time from the favorites page.
